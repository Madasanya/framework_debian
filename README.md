# framework_debian

Welcome to my Debian on Framework Documentation Repository!

In short: as a Windows user for more than 20 years, this is my first attempt at setting up a Linux distro for private use. I decided on Debian, which I now want to get running on my Framework laptop.

In the [Wiki](https://github.com/Madasanya/framework_debian/wiki) you can find the most important information about this small project.

I will try to include not only the technically relevant information, but also how certain decisions were made (sometimes I just wanted to play around with some of the settings) and what will (hopefully) happen next.

Should this project documentation serve anyone as a basis for setting up their own laptop, please question everything thoroughly. I have researched to the best of my knowledge and belief, but this guide makes no claim to completeness, accuracy or that my preferences are the same as yours. Also, some things change very quickly these days.

In addition to the Wiki you can find the used files in the [file folders](https://github.com/Madasanya/framework_debian) of this repo. 

Since many things here are still very new to me, I am grateful for any hints.
